        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
